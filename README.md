[QuantCo Programming Challenge](./QuantCo_Programming_Challenge.pdf)

This programming challenge consists of creating the following custom data types/structures:
1. QuantcoDataFrame
2. QuantcoSeries
The aim of the challenge is to fail fast (using exceptions) in case of unknown values as compared to Pandas dataframe.

## Language
The language used for this repository is Python 3.9.13. The project has not been test to be compatible with other Python versions.

## Repository Structure
The repository consist of the following folders and files:
| S.No |            Files/Folder           |                             Description                            |
|:----:|:---------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:|
